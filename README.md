# Configuration
* See `game/csgo/cfg/SharpTimer/config.cfg` for basic plugin configuration *⚠️ you want to take a look in there first*
  
* You can add custom server settings to `game/csgo/cfg/SharpTimer/custom_exec.cfg`
  
  [Example Surf Cfg](https://github.com/DEAFPS/cs-cfg/blob/main/surf.cfg)

  [Example KZ Cfg](https://github.com/DEAFPS/cs-cfg/blob/main/kz.cfg)
  
### Adding Zone Triggers
* This plugin will look for trigger_multiple entities by default depending what map is being played. By default the plugin tries to hook the following target names:

| Start targetname  | End targetname |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| timer_startzone  | timer_endzone  |
| zone_start | zone_end |
| map_start | map_end  |
| s1_start |   |
| stage1_start |   |


* If the map uses different trigger targetnames or does not have triggers at all (most bhop and deathrun maps dont) you will have to add them into the `.json` files

* To add Map Start and End zones you can simply add the `targetnames` of the triggers inside a `.json` file in `game/csgo/cfg/SharpTimer/MapData` using `MapStartTrigger` and  `MapEndTrigger`

  You can check if a map has built in triggers with the following server commands:
  ```
  sv_cheats true
  ent_find trigger_multiple
  ```

### Adding "Fake" Zone Triggers
* Many maps do not contain any `startzone` or `endzone` triggers. As a server admin with a `@css/root` flag you can use `!addrespawnpos`, `!addstartzone`, `!addendzone` & `!savezones` to manually add "fake" zone triggers! [Example Video](https://streamable.com/9ez6gq)

* Here is a Example of what the `map.json` can look like with both map triggers and manual triggers:

### surf_utopia_njv.json
```
{
  "MapStartTrigger": "zone_start",
  "MapEndTrigger": "zone_end"
}
```
### bhop_zentic.json
```
{
  "MapStartC1": "-67.89055 188.01341 64.03125",
  "MapStartC2": "123.32273 -187.58983 64.03125",
  "MapEndC1": "13736.031 1540.6246 -639.96875",
  "MapEndC2": "13884.47 1915.2767 -639.96875",
  "RespawnPos": "-2 0 64.03125"
}
```
### Adding Zone outline guides
* This plugin will look for info_target entities to define the zone outlines. Mappers can place these at the opposite corners of the zone triggers like shown in [this example](https://i.imgur.com/8nJBHaH.jpeg)
* These are the supported info_target targetnames

| Start Zone info_target targetname  | End Zone info_target targetname |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| left_start  | left_end  |
| right_start | right_end |


# MySQL
* Head over to `game/csgo/cfg/SharpTimer/config.cfg` and enable `sharptimer_mysql_enabled`

  After that configure your MySQL connection in `mysqlConfig.json` that is located in the same dir
